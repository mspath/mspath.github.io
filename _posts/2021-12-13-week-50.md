## aoc day 14 Extended Polymerization

second part of todays AoC was a tricky one again. those puzzles are great for getting a sense of data structures required for tackling problems which can't be just brute forced.

need to revisit this for better solutions.

continued working ond the 'seam carving' project which is fun. provided good algorithms image manipulation is a rewarding activity.

## aoc day 13 Transparent Origami

todays AoC was at the easier side again, still fun. the task basically was folding and mapping/merging points and thus finding a scret key.

also started the 'seam carving' project at the jetbrains academy. this might be interesting since it introduces matrices and image manipulation.
