_will be updated during the month to keep things together_

## aoc day 6

todays AoC 21 was about exponential growth. my initial solution used a recursive approach which was able to yield a result, but my macbook had to work for it.

but once you figure out that you basically just have to keep track of the number of fish based on their lifecycle it becomes hilariously simple to solve. our brains just are not wired for understanding exponential growth.

I also finished the 'simple search engine' project from the 'kotlin developer track'. overall a nice project which does open a spectrum of little cli apps one might want to build for himself.d

## aoc day 7

todays AoC 21 was pretty straighforward. the task was to coordinate a fleet of submarines of a swarm of crabs to fight off a whale.

also started with the 'mines sweeper' project from the 'kotlin developer track'.
