`2021-11-30`

just testing whether my github pages repository still works. magically it does.

I'm thinking about finally making use of these fantastic github pages by keeping a diary of the _100 days of code_ challenge and/or _advent of code 2021_. Nothing fancy or particulary useful, just as some sort of habit for holding myself accountable a bit.
