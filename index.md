### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android development with Kotlin, Jetpack and Compose.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also branching out into Rust and TypeScript / React.
- ðŸŒš I'm working on a Viewer for Mastodon
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m trying to fill the missing days in the Advent of Code series.


Here I've started to collect notes, links and other materials to annotate and complement my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mspath) and [Google developer profile](https://g.dev/hackr)
